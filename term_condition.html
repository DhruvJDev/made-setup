                1.1 <b>Made Setup</b> ("we," "us," "our") operates an e-commerce website that provides products related to PC
                setups, including components, accessories, and complete setups for various categories such as gamers,

                else who accesses the website.

            <h3 class="hed">Eligibility and User Responsibilities</h3>
            <p class="text">
                To be eligible for a refund, items must be returned within 30 days of receipt. Products should be unused
                and
                in
                the same condition as when received. This means that the items should be free from any signs of use,
                damage,
                or
                alterations. Additionally, the original packaging, including any accessories, tags, and documentation,
                must
                be
                intact. This helps us process your return more efficiently and ensures that the product can be resold if
                necessary.

            <h3 class="hed">Non-Returnable</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Certain items are non-returnable for hygiene reasons. These include, but are not limited to, opened
                software,
                custom-made setups, and perishable goods. Custom-made setups, in particular, are tailored to individual
                specifications, making them unique and non-resalable. We encourage you to double-check your order
                details before
                finalizing any custom-made setups to ensure accuracy and satisfaction.

            <h3 class="hed">Process for Items</h3>
            <p class="text">
                To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team. Provide your order number and reason for
                the
                return. Our team will guide you through the process and provide you with a return authorization number
                (RAN).
                This number is crucial for tracking your return and ensuring it is processed correctly.
                <br>
                Once you have the RAN, package the item securely, including all original packaging, accessories, and
                documentation. Clearly label the package with the RAN to avoid any delays. Ship the item back to us
                using a
                trackable shipping method. We recommend keeping a copy of the shipping receipt for your records.

            <h3 class="hed">Shipping Costs Return</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Shipping costs for returns are the responsibility of the customer. However, if the return is due to an
                error
                on
                our part, such as shipping the wrong item or a defective product, we will cover the shipping costs. In
                such
                cases, our customer service team will provide you with a prepaid shipping label. Simply attach the label
                to
                the
                package and drop it off at the nearest shipping center.

            <p class="text">
                Once your return is received and inspected, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your
                refund.
                Approved refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days. The refund will be applied to your original
                method
                of payment. Please note that it may take additional time for your bank or credit card company to process
                and
                post the refund to your account.

            <p class="text">
                Partial refunds may be granted in certain situations, such as for items not in their original condition,
                or
                items returned more than 30 days after delivery. If an item is not in its original condition, is
                damaged, or
                missing parts for reasons not due to our error, we may deduct a restocking fee from your refund. Our
                customer
                service team will provide you with detailed information regarding any deductions from your refund.
